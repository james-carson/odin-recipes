    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shakshuka is the ultimate brunch food. Luxurious, eggy (therefore protein) and delicious. This is an Israeli dish that can found across the Middle East.</p>
    <p>It's great as it is, served with some good bread, but can also be modified (sorry, purists) to suit your tastes - fry some fatty meat before the onions, add some hot or some smoky chillies... However you want. You can't go wrong.</p>
    <p>Be warned: it's very filling. A pan for two might look reasonable, but you probably won't finish it. No problem, heat it up again tomorrow, or have it as a side... Whatever you want. Just eat it. lots of it.</p>
