    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Welsh Rarebit has nothing to do with rabbit, or potentially even Wales (careful), but is instead a simple, tasty recipe that is essentially posh cheese on toast</p>
    <p>If you're going to follow the recipe properly, then you are going to need to put beer in it (does that make it Welsh?), but this is a breakfast, brucnh or lunch recipe and who's cracking open a tinnie at 10am? The Welsh?</p>
    <p>Personally, I make it with a splash of milk, rather than beer, which still makes it taste beautiful. Don't skimp on the cheese, or even the bread, as this simple dish is all about high-quality ingredients.</p>
