    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Welsh Rarebit has nothing to do with rabbit, or potentially even Wales (careful), but is instead a simple, tasty recipe that is essentially posh cheese on toast</p>
    <p>If you're going to follow the recipe properly, then you are going to need to put beer in it (does that make it Welsh?), but this is a breakfast, brucnh or lunch recipe and who's cracking open a tinnie at 10am? The Welsh?</p>
    <p>Personally, I make it with a splash of milk, rather than beer, which still makes it taste beautiful. Don't skimp on the cheese, or even the bread, as this simple dish is all about high-quality ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <Li>120ml brown ale (or milk, as stated above)</Li>
        <Li>25g unsalted butter</Li>
        <Li>25g plain flour</Li>
        <Li>140g mature cheddar, coarsely grated</Li>
        <Li>1 heaped tsp English mustard powder</Li>
        <Li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</Li>
        <Li>1 tbsp chopped chives</Li>
        <Li>2 large slices sourdough bread</Li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <Li>In a small saucepan gently warm the ale, set aside.</Li>
        <Li>Take another small saucepan and over a medium heat melt the butter until it begins to foam, tip in the flour and stir everything together, cooking for 1 min. </Li>
        <Li>Whisk in the warm ale in several additions to create a thick sauce then whisk through the cheese to create a thick paste.</Li>
        <Li>Stir the mustard, Worcestershire and chives through the sauce.</Li>
        <Li>Heat a grill to its highest setting. Place the slices of bread on a flat baking sheet and grill on one side until golden brown.</Li>
        <Li>Flip the bread over and spread each one with the cheese mixture.</Li>
        <Li>Place back under the grill and cook for a further 1-2 mins or until golden brown and bubbling, serve immediately.</Li>
    </ol>
