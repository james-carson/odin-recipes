    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If I have time on a Sunday and have a long time in which I can cook, Chilli (Chile?) Con Carne is my go-to.</p>
    <p>Most people, where I am from in the UK, anyway, think of this as a Mexican dish, but its history is more complicated than that. It's a Tex-Mex dish, originating from Mexican immigrants in the US, cooking for locals with the ingredients they were able to acquire locally.</p>
    <p>Most recipes call for minced beef. Don't do it! Get a nice big slab of beef that you can cut into chunks that will fall apart when cooked for a long time. Also, a proper chilli sauce made from proper dried chillis is essential. Don't half-arse this - your tastebuds will thank you.</p>
