    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If I have time on a Sunday and have a long time in which I can cook, Chilli (Chile?) Con Carne is my go-to.</p>
    <p>Most people, where I am from in the UK, anyway, think of this as a Mexican dish, but its history is more complicated than that. It's a Tex-Mex dish, originating from Mexican immigrants in the US, cooking for locals with the ingredients they were able to acquire locally.</p>
    <p>Most recipes call for minced beef. Don't do it! Get a nice big slab of beef that you can cut into chunks that will fall apart when cooked for a long time. Also, a proper chilli sauce made from proper dried chillis is essential. Don't half-arse this - your tastebuds will thank you.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <Li>2-2.5 lbs. chuck roast (or alternative cut) - cut into 1-1.5" pieces</Li>
        <Li>3 Ancho dried chillies - whole</Li>
        <Li>3 Guajillo dried chillies - whole</Li>
        <Li>1 Onion - chopped</Li>
        <Li>1 Bell pepper - chopped</Li>
        <Li>4 Garlic cloves - chopped</Li>
        <Li>3-4 Roma tomatoes - chopped (or can of whole tomatoes)</Li>
        <Li>1 Chipotle in adobo (optional)</Li>
        <Li>1-2 Cans beans (I use kidney)</Li>
        <Li>5 Cups stock (ideally beef)</Li>
        <Li>1 Tablespoon Mexican oregano</Li>
        <Li>1/2 Teaspoon cumin</Li>
        <Li>1 Teaspoon salt (plus more to taste)</Li>
        <Li>Freshly cracked black pepper</Li>
        <Li>Optional but recommended: Dark chocolate, ground coffee and/or worcestershire sauce</Li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <Li>De-stem and de-seed the chillies, but don't worry about getting rid of every last seed. Toast them in a pan for 1-2 minutes or until warm and fragrant. Add the roasted chilli pieces to a bowl and cover them with boiling water. Let them reconstitute for 30 minutes or so.</Li>
        <Li>Rinse and de-stem the tomatoes. Roast them in a 200C oven for 20-30 minutes or until you need them. If using a can, just pour into a big bowl and crush with your hands.</Li>
        <Li>Preheat your main pot over medium-high heat along with a glug of oil. Chop up the beef into 1-1.5" chunks and give it a good salting. You can discard any fat pieces that you don't want in your Chilli. Sear the beef chunks in the pot until they are browning on all sides. Once browned, set the beef pieces aside.</Li>
        <Li>In the same pot, add the finely chopped onion along with another glug of oil. Cook the onion over medium heat until softened. Then add 4 minced garlic cloves and briefly cook.</Li>
        <Li>Before draining the reconstituted chiles take a taste of the soaking liquid. If it tastes bitter to you then use stock to combine the chiles. If you like the flavor you are welcome to use the soaking liquid in place of the stock</Li>
        <Li>Add the drained chillies to the blender along with a single roasted tomato and a single chipotle in adobo (optional). I usually cut off the stem and scrape out the seeds of the chipotle. Half of the onion-garlic mixture should already be in the blender. Add a single cup of stock (or soaking liquid) and combine well. Feel free to add a bit more liquid if it won't combine readily.</Li>
        <Li>Add the chilli puree to the main pot along with: 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, freshly cracked black pepper, and the 4 cups of the stock. Combine well and then add the seared beef pieces (along with their juices) and the remaining tomatoes.</Li>
        <Li>Bring this up to a simmer, cover, and let cook for 1.5-2 hours or until the beef is tender. I often like to cook for longer in the overn, but you'll probably need to top up with water if you do it this way.</Li>
        <Li>Add the beans 5 minutes before you're finished cooking and serve immediately.</Li>
    </ol>
