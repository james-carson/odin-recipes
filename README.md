This will be my first project on TOP after learning basic HTML (which I already knew, actually). 

I think that the aim will be to practise writing HTML and to demonstrate that I am able to make a basic website that can link to other internal pages.

I'm not yet on CSS, so it's not going to look great, but I can at least use headers, images and links.

I think that this may really be more about learning to add and commit with Git rather than creating the website itself.
